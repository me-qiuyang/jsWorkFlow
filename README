jsWorkFlow's road map
1. use M$'s AJAX as a base framework(temporary, may be changed in furture).
2. build a workflow runtime engine for javascript.
3. create necessary activities.
4. create WorkFlow's designer(HTML5+JavaScript)
5. support load from xml and run.

About events & property
    Events of activities are designed to be used by activity's writer, and it's 
content's (handler) will not be seralized by serialize context. So, all contents 
used by end-user should build them workflow by activities. 

About serialize a running activity
    Activity serialize context dosn't support serialize a running activity. And this
requirement will not be consider in the nearly future. End-user who have this requirements
should consider how restart them activities by serialized data and activities. This meen
jsWorkFlow would like use retry instead searialize a running activity.
